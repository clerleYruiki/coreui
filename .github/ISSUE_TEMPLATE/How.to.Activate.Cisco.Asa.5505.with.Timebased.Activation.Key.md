# How to Activate Cisco Asa 5505 with Time-based Activation Key
 
Cisco Asa 5505 is a security appliance that provides firewall, VPN, and other features for small and medium-sized businesses. To enable some of these features, you need to activate your device with a license key. A license key is a 160-bit value that encodes the serial number and the enabled features of your device. You can obtain a license key from Cisco Licensing team or from a reseller.

In this article, we will show you how to activate Cisco Asa 5505 with a time-based activation key. A time-based activation key is a special type of license key that allows you to activate features for a specific time period. This can be useful if you want to test or use some features temporarily without buying a permanent license.
 
## Step 1: Get your Product Activation Key (PAK)
 
The first step is to get your Product Activation Key (PAK) for the device. A PAK is a code that you need to register on Cisco website to get your license key. You can get a PAK from Cisco Licensing team or from a reseller. You need to provide the serial number of your device when you request a PAK. You can find the serial number by using the `show version` command on your device.
 
For example, here is the output of `show version` on a Cisco Asa 5505:

    ciscoasa# show version
    Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.12 (2)
    Firepower Extensible Operating System Version 2.6 (1.141)
    Device Manager Version 7.12 (2)

The serial number in this example is **9A5KG6HTQSB**. You need to provide this number when you request a PAK.
 
## Step 2: Register your PAK on Cisco website
 
The next step is to register your PAK on Cisco website to get your license key. You need to have a Cisco account to do this. If you don't have one, you can create one for free on [Cisco Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html).
 
Once you have an account, go to [Cisco License Registration Portal](https://www.cisco.com/go/license) and follow these steps:
