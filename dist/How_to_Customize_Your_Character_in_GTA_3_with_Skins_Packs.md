# How to Customize Your Character in GTA 3 with Skins Packs
 
Grand Theft Auto III is one of the most iconic and influential games of all time, but it also has a very limited selection of character skins. You can only choose between a few outfits for Claude, the silent protagonist, and some of them are only available in certain missions or cutscenes. If you want to spice up your gameplay and give Claude a new look, you can use skins packs to change his appearance.

Skins packs are collections of custom-made skins that replace the original ones in the game. They can range from realistic to cartoonish, from serious to funny, from original to inspired by other games or movies. You can find hundreds of skins packs online, created by talented modders who share their work for free. Some of the most popular ones are:
 
- **Skins from games and movies**: This pack by Vone[^1^] adds clothes and characters from various games and movies, such as Resident Evil, Metal Gear Solid, The Matrix, The Terminator, and more.
- **New skins for Claude**: This pack by Vone[^2^] adds more options for Claude's outfits, such as a leather jacket, a suit, a hoodie, a police uniform, and more.
- **Claude Skins Pack**: This pack by flame flower[^1^] adds 10 different skins for Claude, including some variations of his original clothes and some new ones.
- **Claude Remastered**: This pack by Spongeyy[^1^] improves Claude's textures and makes him look more detailed and realistic.
- **GTA 3 Skin Pack**: This pack by GTA3 Skin Editor[^4^] includes both black and white versions of Claude, as well as some other characters from the game.

To install skins packs, you need to download them first and extract them to a folder. Then, you need to use a tool called IMG Tool[^5^] to open the file gta3.img in your GTA 3 installation folder. This file contains all the game's data, including the skins. You need to replace the original skin files with the ones from the pack you want to use. For example, if you want to use the skin player.bmp from the Skins from games and movies pack, you need to find the file player.bmp in gta3.img and replace it with the one from the pack. You can also backup the original files before replacing them, in case you want to restore them later.
 
After replacing the files, you can launch GTA 3 and enjoy your new character skin. You can also switch between different skins by using the menu option "Change Clothes" in your safehouse. Some skins may not work properly with some missions or cutscenes, so be aware of that. If you encounter any problems or bugs, you can try uninstalling the skins pack or reinstalling the game.
 
Skins packs are a great way to customize your character in GTA 3 and make your gameplay more fun and diverse. You can find many more skins packs online and try them out yourself. Just remember to always follow the instructions of the modders and respect their work.
