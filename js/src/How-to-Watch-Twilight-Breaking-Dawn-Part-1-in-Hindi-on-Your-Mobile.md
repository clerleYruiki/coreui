One way is to use a streaming service that offers the movie in Hindi. There are some platforms that have the rights to stream the movie in different languages, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, or Hotstar. However, you might need to check if the movie is available in your region and if you have a subscription to access it.
 
Another way is to download the movie from a torrent site that has the Hindi dubbed version. This is a risky option, as you might encounter viruses, malware, or legal issues. You also need to have a torrent client and a VPN to download the movie safely and anonymously. You should also be aware of the ethical implications of downloading pirated content.
 
A third way is to use a video converter tool that can change the audio track of the movie from English to Hindi. This is a more complicated option, as you need to have the original movie file and a software that can perform the conversion. You also need to find a reliable source for the Hindi audio track, which might not match the quality or timing of the video.
 
As you can see, there are some ways to watch Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 1 in Hindi on your mobile device, but none of them are perfect or easy. You might want to consider watching the movie in English instead, or wait for an official release of the Hindi version.
